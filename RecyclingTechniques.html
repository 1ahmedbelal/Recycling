      <h2>Mechanical Recycling</h2>
      <p>
        Mechanical recycling involves physical processes like shredding, washing, and re-extruding plastics.
        It is commonly used because it is cost-effective; however, repeated recycling can lead to polymer degradation,
        reducing the strength and quality of the plastic. Additionally, contamination from mixed materials can make the 
        recycled product less pure and lower its market value.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Process:</strong> Shredding, washing, re-extruding</li>
        <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Quality loss, contamination, economic disadvantages</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Chemical Recycling</h2>
      <p>
        Chemical recycling breaks down plastics into their original monomers using chemical reactions.
        This process can produce higher quality recycled material that retains many of the original properties.
        However, this method requires higher energy input and is more expensive compared to mechanical recycling.
        Its scalability is limited by high cost and process complexity.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Process:</strong> Chemical breakdown into monomers</li>
        <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Higher quality, longer-lasting products</li>
        <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> High energy demand, cost, scalability issues</li>
      </ul>
