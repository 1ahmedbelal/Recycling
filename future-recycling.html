      <h2>Emerging Technologies and Innovations</h2>
      <p>
        New technologies are reshaping the landscape of plastic recycling. Advanced robotics and AI-driven sorting systems are increasing efficiency and accuracy.
        Ongoing research focuses on decreasing the energy consumption in chemical recycling while integrating renewable energy sources to power recycling plants,
        which could significantly enhance the quality and scalability of recycled materials.

      <h2>Policy and Economic Drivers</h2>
      <p>
        Policies and economic incentives play a crucial role in adopting advanced recycling technologies. Governments around the world are closing the price gap 
        between recycled and virgin plastics by offering subsidies and tax benefits. Public awareness and support further drive the adoption of these green technologies.
